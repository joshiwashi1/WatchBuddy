WatchBuddy: Mini Movie Watchlist
WatchBuddy is designed to help movie enthusiasts manage their personal watchlists.  It solves the common problem of forgetting which movies to watch and keeping track of completed ones. 
It also provides a personal review and rating system, allowing users to document their viewing experience and reflect on the movies theyâ€™ve watched.
